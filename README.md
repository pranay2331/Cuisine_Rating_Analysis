## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Explore the dataset of cuisine ratings.
- Analyze trends such as the popularity of certain cuisines, average ratings, and correlations between variables.
- Present findings visually using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about various cuisines and their ratings. It includes the following columns:
- `Cuisine`: The type of cuisine.
- `Rating`: The rating given to the cuisine.
- (Add other columns based on your dataset if needed.)

The dataset is loaded into the analysis using Pandas.

## Analysis Steps
The notebook includes the following steps:
1. **Import Libraries**: Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
2. **Load Dataset**: The dataset is read into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. **Data Exploration**:
   - Inspecting the structure of the dataset.
   - Checking for missing or duplicate data.
4. **Visual Analysis**:
   - Distribution of ratings across cuisines.
   - Correlation analysis and trend identification.
5. **Insights and Findings**: Key observations from the data.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Cuisine_Rating_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd Cuisine_Rating_Analysis
   ```
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Cuisine_Rating_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Results
The analysis uncovered key trends such as:
- The most highly rated cuisines.
- Patterns in how cuisines are rated.
- Visualizations showcasing the data's distribution and relationships.

## Conclusions
The findings from this project can help understand customer preferences in cuisine ratings and could be extended to predict future trends with further modeling.
